            <p>In this task, you are given a goal and a step of completing this goal. You are required to determine if a step is essential for completing the goal or not. A step is essential if without
                it, it is impossible to finish the goal.</p>

                        <li> 2 means that it is very essential. The goal is impossible to be finished without it.</li>
                        <li> 1 means that it is somewhat essential. The step seems to be important, but you are not so sure.

                        <li> 0 means that you do not have a preference.</li>

                        <li> -2 means that it is not essential at all. Removing it will not influence the overall goal
